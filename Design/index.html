                        <h4>Yin and Yang</h4>
                        
                        <p>The philosophy of yin and yang is how i approach design. Everything in this worlds laws works within that philosphy. This creates a direct partnership with design and the world around us. My main goal when designing is to balance aesthetics and praticality. </p>
                        
                        <p> My main passion for design and all creative fields is that you can be inspired by everything surrounding you. I believe its a precious field where every part of someones knowledge can be implemented into there work</p>
